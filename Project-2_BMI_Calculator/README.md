# BMI Calculator - Code README

This README provides an overview of the code structure, usage instructions, and additional details for the BMI Calculator project.

## Code Structure

The project consists of two main tasks:

1. The implementation of the BMI calculator at the beginner level, with a command-line interface (CLI).
   
2. The implements the BMI calculator at the advanced level, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter. It also includes data storage capabilities using SQLite and visualization of BMI trends with Matplotlib.

Additionally, the project includes a `requirements.txt` file listing the required dependencies for running the code.

## Usage

### Beginner Level (CLI):

To use the BMI calculator at the beginner level, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `bmi_calculator.py` script.
3. Run the script using Python:
4. Follow the prompts to input your weight (in kilograms) and height (in meters).
5. The program will calculate your BMI and display the result along with the corresponding health category.

### Advanced Level (GUI):

To use the BMI calculator at the advanced level with a GUI, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Tkinter, SQLite3, and Matplotlib installed (see Requirements section).
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the directory containing the `bmi_calculator.py` script.
4. Run the script using Python:
5. The GUI window will appear, allowing you to input your weight and height.
6. Click the "Calculate BMI" button to calculate your BMI and display the result.
7. Optionally, use the "View BMI Trend" button to visualize the BMI trend over time.
8. You can also use the "Quit" button to close the application.

## Requirements

To run the code, you need the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (for GUI)
- SQLite3 (for data storage)
- Matplotlib (for plotting BMI trend)

## Install the dependencies using pip by running:
- pip install -r requirements.txt
